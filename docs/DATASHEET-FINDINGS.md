# Datasheet findings: what changes, and the page that says so

Every row is a change to the board or libraries, traced to the page, table or figure of the
manufacturer datasheet that mandates it. Page numbers are **PDF page numbers** in the file
held in `hardware/datasheets/`, with the document's own section/table/figure number alongside,
because the two rarely agree.

Nothing in this document is engineering opinion. Where a change is a judgement call rather
than a datasheet requirement, it is marked **[judgement]** and the reasoning is given.

**Status: 14 of 14 parts documented.** SW3 is verified against a drawing that exists only as a screenshot, see its provenance warning.

## U1: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2 (Espressif)

`hardware/datasheets/ESP32-S3-WROOM-1.pdf`, Datasheet v1.8

| # | Change required | Datasheet reference | Current state |
|---|---|---|---|
| U1-1 | **Clear all copper from the antenna keep-out zone, on both layers.** Board coords x 23.0 to 41.0, y 37.36 to 43.39 | **PDF p.10**, §3.1 Pin Layout: diagram labelled "Keepout Zone"; **PDF p.45**, Fig 10.1 Module Dimensions: "Antenna Area", 7.49 mm | F.Cu **84.4 %** copper, B.Cu **81.3 %** copper. No keep-out zone exists. |
| U1-2 | **Set pin electrical types**: pins 1, 2, 40, 41 → `power_in`; pin 3 (EN) → `input`; pins 4 to 39 → `bidirectional` | **PDF p.11**, Table 3-1 Pin Definitions, "Type" column: `P` = power, `I` = input, `I/O/T` = input/output/tristate | All 41 pins are `unspecified` in `JLC.kicad_sym`. ERC electrical checking is off board-wide. |
| U1-3 | Pin numbering and names: **no change needed** | **PDF p.11**, Table 3-1 | Verified: 41 pins, 40 of 41 names match exactly. Pin 41 is named `GND` in the symbol vs `EPAD` in the table: Table 3-1 gives EPAD's Function as "GND", so this is correct and arguably clearer. |
| U1-4 | **Verified 2026-08-07**: EN and boot strapping match the reference design | Espressif reference schematic (WROOM-1 variant) | EN: R9 10 kΩ pull-up to 3V3 + C4 100 nF to GND + SW2 (reset to GND): exactly the datasheet's 10 kΩ/0.1 µF RC. IO0: R10 10 kΩ pull-up + SW1 (boot to GND). GPIO45/46/3 float at their default straps (VDD_SPI = 3.3 V). USB polarity correct: pin 13 IO19 = D− = USB_DM, pin 14 IO20 = D+ = USB_DP, matching J2 A7/B7 = D− and A6/B6 = D+. Deviation from reference: no 499 Ω series on U0TXD and no ESD diode on EN: both belong to the auto-download circuit of a permanent USB-UART bridge; J1 here is passive program pads, so they are optional. |

**Note on variant:** the board uses **WROOM-1** (integrated PCB antenna), not WROOM-1U (external
connector). Datasheet **p.10** states explicitly that WROOM-1U "has no antenna keepout zone."
The keep-out requirement in U1-1 applies *because* this is the -1 variant.

## U4: ST25DV04KC-IE6S3 (STMicroelectronics)

`hardware/datasheets/ST25DV04KC.pdf`, DS13519 Rev 8. Footprint
`ST25DV.pretty/SO-8_L4.9-W3.9-P1.27-LS5.9-BL.kicad_mod`

| # | Change required | Datasheet reference | Current state |
|---|---|---|---|
| U4-1 | **Change `(attr through_hole)` to `(attr smd)`** | **PDF p.151**, §10.1 SO8N package information: an SO8N is a gull-wing surface-mount package; all 8 pads in the footprint are already `smd` | `(attr through_hole)` on an all-SMD part. Drives position-file output and PCBA classification: the same failure class as the SW3 rejection. |
| U4-2 | **Extend the courtyard to enclose the pads.** Pads reach y ±3.644; courtyard stops at y ±1.960 | Derived from the land pattern, **PDF p.151**, Fig 85 | Pads sit **1.684 mm outside the courtyard** on both sides. DRC cannot detect encroachment on most of this part's copper. |
| U4-3 | **Add `F.Fab` body outline: 4.9 × 3.9 mm** (D typ × E1 typ) | **PDF p.151**, Table 259 SO8N Mechanical data: D = 4.800/4.900/5.000, E1 = 3.800/3.900/4.000 | No `F.Fab` geometry at all. |
| U4-4 | **Fix the 3D model path** to `${KIPRJMOD}/…` | n/a: repo hygiene, not a datasheet item | `nfc_integration/ST25DV.3dshapes/…`, relative to a directory that does not exist. |
| U4-5 | **[judgement]** Consider redrawing pads to ST's recommendation | **PDF p.151**, Fig 85 SO8N Footprint example: 0.6 mm pad width ×8, 1.27 mm pitch, 6.7 mm outer span, 3.9 mm inner gap (⇒ 1.4 mm pad length) | See table below. Deviates but will function. |

### U4-5 detail: land pattern vs Figure 85

| Dimension | Datasheet (Fig 85) | Footprint | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pitch | 1.27 mm | 1.27 mm | ✓ |
| Pad width | 0.60 mm | 0.574 mm | −4 % |
| Pad length | 1.40 mm | 1.888 mm | **+35 %** |
| Outer span | 6.70 mm | 7.288 mm | +0.59 mm |
| Inner gap | 3.90 mm | 3.512 mm | −0.39 mm |

**Verdict: functional, not correct.** Pads are longer than ST recommends in both directions.
Outward extension is harmless and aids inspection. Inward extension is the questionable half,
ST puts the inner pad edge flush with the body (E1 = 3.9 mm), and this footprint runs **0.194 mm
under the package on each side**. At 1.27 mm pitch that is unlikely to cause wicking, and the
narrower pad still covers the lead (b = 0.28 to 0.48 mm, **Table 259**). Joints will form.

This is a *deviation from the manufacturer's recommendation that nobody had compared*, not a
defect that stops the board working. Fixing it is the same work as U4-2 and U4-3, so do all
three together if the footprint is redrawn.

## SW3: MSK12C02 (SHOU HAN): VERIFIED against the manufacturer drawing

`hardware/datasheets/MSK12C02.pdf` (7-page specification) and
`hardware/datasheets/MSK12C02-outline-drawing.png` (mechanical drawing, from the LCSC
product page, **not** in the PDF).

**No change required.** Every checkable dimension of KiCad's shipped
`Button_Switch_SMD.pretty/SW_SPDT_Shouhan_MSK12C02.kicad_mod` matches the drawing:

| Feature | Drawing | Footprint |
|---|---|---|
| Mounting holes | 2 × Ø0.85, 3.0 mm apart | 2 × Ø0.85 NPTH at (±1.5, 0) |
| Post diameter on the part | Ø0.75 ±0.1 | 0.10 mm clearance in the hole |
| Signal pads | 0.6 × 1.3, spacing **1.5 and 3.0** | −2.25 / 0.75 / 2.25 |
| Shield pads | 1.05 × 0.7, outer 8.4 / inner 6.3 | ±3.675, ±1.1 |

### Two traps recorded, because both cost time

**The non-uniform pin spacing is correct.** 1.5 mm on one side and 3.0 mm on the other looks
like a library error and is not, the drawing dimensions it that way. Do not "fix" it.

**The specification text contradicts the drawing.** §2.4 states "1 pole, 1 throw" and §2.3
says "tactile feedback", and the cover calls the part 轻触开关 (*tactile switch*). The
drawing's 电路图 shows ①②③ plus ④ as shield, unambiguously SPDT. The text sections of that
PDF are a vendor template with the wrong product's content; **the drawing is the authority.**

**Three prongs vs two holes:** the part has **two** Ø0.75 mounting posts, which is what the
two holes are for. The three items that read as vertical prongs in the 3D render are the
signal terminals ①②③, flat 0.15 mm tabs that solder to the surface, per the end view and
the mounting diagram. If the STEP model renders them as vertical pins it misrepresents the
part; cosmetic only, no fabrication consequence.

### Provenance warning

The mechanical drawing exists in this repo **only as a screenshot** of the LCSC product page.
The linked PDF (`lcsc_datasheet_2304140030_SHOU-HAN-MSK12C02_C431540.pdf`) is byte-identical
to `MSK12C02.pdf` and contains no drawing, verified by MD5. Its §8.1 refers the reader to an
"outside drawing page" that is not distributed with it. A screenshot is a fragile primary
source for the one part that has already been rejected once by a fab. Replace it when a
proper copy can be obtained.

## Passives: land patterns not changed

| Part | Datasheet | Package data | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| CC0603KRX7R9BB104 (C1: C6) | `CC0603KRX7R9BB104-YAGEO-CC-series.pdf` | 0603: 1.6 ±0.15 × 0.8 ±0.15 × 0.8 ±0.15 | none: uses KiCad's IPC-7351 land |
| CL21A106KAYNNNE (C8) | `CL21A106KAYNNNE-Samsung-CL21A-series.pdf` | CL21A = 0805 (2012) | none: as above |
| CL21A226MAQNNNE (C9, C10) | same Samsung series document | CL21A = 0805 (2012) | none for the footprint: **see below** |
| 0603WAF series (R1: R14) | `UNI-ROYAL-0603WAF-series.pdf` | 0603 thick film | none: as above |

**C10, resolved 2026-08-07.** Schematic `Value` corrected from `100uF` to `22uF` to match
the MPN `CL21A226MAQNNNE` actually on the BOM. The rail carries C9 + C10 = 44 µF of bulk,
and the ME6211C33 LDO requires only 1 µF at its output, so 22 µF is electrically sound.
The BOM keeps its note to consider a 1206-size 100 µF next revision for extra WiFi-burst
headroom on coin-cell power.

## Remaining work: datasheets now held, changes not yet made

| Part | Manufacturer | LCSC | Refs | Outstanding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LSM6DS3TR-C** | STMicroelectronics | C967633 | U2 | LGA-14, 0.5 mm pitch: the tightest land on the board. Courtyard 0.098 mm inside the pads on all four sides. No `F.Fab`. Dead 3D model path. |
| **CR2032-BS-6-1** | Q&J | C70377 | BT1 | Courtyard **2.240 mm** inside the pads. `(attr through_hole)` on an SMD holder. Footprint named "TH" while its own 3D model is named "SMD". Keep-out needed under the cell (74 % copper there today). |
| **TS-1187A-B-A-B** | XKB Connection | C318884 | SW1, SW2 | Courtyard 0.950 mm inside the pads. No pin-1 marker. Dead 3D model path. |
| **KT-0603R** | Hubei KENTO | C2286 | D1: D24 | ×24 placements. **Zero** courtyard clearance in y. Ø0.20 mm silk dot centred on pad 1's corner: ink on the land, on every one. Dead 3D model path. |

| CL21A106KAYNNNE | Samsung | C15850 | C8 | As above. |
| CL21A226MAQNNNE | Samsung | C45783 | C9, C10 | Resolved: schematic Value corrected to 22 µF, matching the MPN. |
| 0603WAF-series | UNI-ROYAL | C22962/25804/23162/25803 | R1: R14 | As above. |
| **C12** |: | *none* | C12 | No part chosen. 62 pF NP0, 56 to 68 pF window, tuned against the coil after VNA. The ST25DV datasheet sets the target; the part decision comes after that. |

## How to read a datasheet for this purpose

For each part, four things produce four changes:

1. **Mechanical data table** (dimensions D, E, E1, b, e) → the `F.Fab` body outline
2. **Recommended footprint / land pattern figure** → pad size, pitch, span
3. **Pin definitions table, "Type" column** → pin electrical types, which is what makes ERC work
4. **Any keep-out, thermal or layout note** → zones and placement constraints

If a datasheet gives no recommended land pattern, IPC-7351 is the fallback authority, and we do
not hold it. Record that as a gap rather than inventing a pattern.
